# AdventOfCode2022

Repository for sharing my code to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles which I have solved.
Currently, there is still another repository named [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/ProfSchmergmann/AdventOfCode)
in which I solved some puzzles from 2019 to 2021 with Java.

Below you can find a list of the Days I solved with the correct result and the computing time for each part.

The times are based on computing the results on my tower PC. 
The specs are:
- [AMD Ryzen 5 3600](https://www.amd.com/de/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600)
- [AMD Radeon RX 5700](https://www.amd.com/de/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700)
- 16 GB DDR4 RAM with 3200MHz

# AdventOfCode2022

Repository for sharing my code to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles which I have solved.
Currently, there is still another repository named [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/ProfSchmergmann/AdventOfCode)
in which I solved some puzzles from 2019 to 2021 with Java.
